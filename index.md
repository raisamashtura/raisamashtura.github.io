# Raisa Mashtura

My name is Raisa Mashtura (she/her), and I am currently serving as a Lecturer in the Department of Computer Science & Engineering at BRAC University. I hold a Bachelor of Science degree in Electrical and Electronic Engineering from Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET), where I specialized in Communication & Signal Processing, achieving a CGPA of 3.90/4.00. I graduated at the top of my major and ranked within the top 7.5% of my class across the entire department.

My research interests are focused on Medical Image Processing and Quantum Machine Learning. I am actively seeking PhD opportunities in these fields for the Fall 2025 session.

### Undergraduate Thesis
- **[Designing a Quantum Convolutional Neural Network with Novel Entanglement Layers for the Classification of Classical Data](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.11792)**
  - **Supervisor**: [Dr. Shaikh Anowarul Fattah](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qDG3vBUAAAAJ&hl=en)
  - **Period**: April 2022 - May 2023
  - **Abstract**: We designed and benchmarked a highly entangled Quantum Convolutional Neural Network (QCNN) and tested its performance on benchmarked datasets for binary and multiclass classification, giving state-of-the-art results. The QCNN model is optimized such that it can be deployed using a feasible number of qubits in NISQ (Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum) devices. Further studies were also conducted on the model devised as well as other QCNN models.

### Current Work
- **Colon cancer survival prediction from whole slide images and genomics data using multimodal learning of a hybrid quantum-classical deep learning network**
  - **Supervisor**: Dr. Shaikh Anowarul Fattah 
  - **Period**: March 2024 - Present
  - **Abstract**: We designed a hybrid Quantum-Classical Neural Network (QCNN) to extract histopathological features and tissue area features from whole slide images of the TCGA-COAD dataset. These features were then combined with their corresponding genomic data and fed into existing state-of-the-art survival models.
