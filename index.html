    <p><b>Designing a Quantum Convolutional Neural Network with Novel Entanglement Layers for the Classification of Classical Data</b><br>
    <i>Supervisor:</i> Dr. Shaikh Anowarul Fattah <br>
    April 2022 - May 2023</p>
    <p>We designed and benchmarked a highly entangled Quantum Convolutional Neural Network (QCNN) and tested its performance on benchmarked datasets for binary and multiclass classification, giving state-of-the-art results. The QCNN model is optimized such that it can be deployed using a feasible number of qubits in NISQ (Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum) devices. Further studies were also conducted on the model devised as well as other QCNN models.</p>

    <p><b>Colon cancer survival prediction from whole slide images and genomics data using multimodal learning of a hybrid quantum-classical deep learning network</b><br>
    <i>Supervisor:</i> Dr. Shaikh Anowarul Fattah <br>
    March 2024 - Present</p>
    <p>We designed a hybrid Quantum-Classical Neural Network (QCNN) to extract histopathological features and tissue area features from whole slide images of the TCGA-COAD dataset. These features were then combined with their corresponding genomic data and fed into existing state-of-the-art survival models.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><b>Gas Leak Detection & Explosion Prevention with Air Quality Monitoring System</b><br>
      Designed an ultimate engineering solution against gas leak explosions by detecting gas leaks and taking preventive measures such as limiting them and alerting the user via a mobile phone call. Air quality measurements were also taken.</li><br>

      <li><b>Aquatic Multi-purpose Robot for Water Surface Trash Cleaning and Water Quality Monitoring</b><br>
      Designed a cost-effective robot to detect and collect trash on water surfaces, both by automated and manual control. It also had sensors to detect water quality such as pH and temperature.</li><br>

      <li><b>Design of a 4-bit Calculator</b><br>
      Designed separate circuit blocks for performing operations: encoding, enabling, addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and decoding. These blocks were integrated to obtain a fully functional calculator.</li><br>

      <li><b>COVID-19 Forecasting in Bangladesh</b><br>
      Time series prediction of the number of COVID-19 cases in Bangladesh using Fbprophet, LSTM, and MLP models.</li><br>

      <li><b>Intelligent Gesture Based Security System</b><br>
      Designed a contactless security system that is unlocked by means of a stored hand gesture pattern. The simulation was performed using MATLAB, VSPE, Arduino, and Proteus.</li><br>

      <li><b>Electronic Analog Computer Solving a Second Order Differential Equation</b><br>
      Designed an electronic circuit using Pspice and op-amps that electrically solves any second-order differential equation.</li><br>

      <li><b>Transformers: Voltage Regulation and Efficiency</b><br>
      Parameters of a three-phase or single-phase transformer were obtained using GUI, and plots of voltage regulation, efficiency against load, and the equivalent circuit were displayed on the GUI window. Simulation was carried out using MATLAB.</li><br>

      <li><b>Design of a Two-unit Multi-storied Building using Autocad</b><br>
      Planned and designed a layout and electrical connection of a six-storied building.</li><br>

      <li><b>Investigating the Effect of HVDC Connection and Large Industrial Loads in IEEE-39 Bus Network</b><br>
      Investigated various types of faults occurring on different loading conditions in a multi-bus power system using PSAF.</li><br>
