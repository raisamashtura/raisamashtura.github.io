        <p>Hello! My name is Raisa Mashtura. I am a Lecturer at the Department of Computer Science & Engineering at BRAC University. My research interests include Digital Signal Processing, Quantum Machine Learning, and Neural Networks.</p>
        
        <p>I hold a Bachelor of Science degree in Electrical and Electronic Engineering from Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET), where I specialized in Communication & Signal-Processing with a CGPA of 3.90/4.00.</p>
        
        <p>I have worked on numerous projects, including designing a Quantum Convolutional Neural Network for the Classification of Classical Data, which was part of my undergraduate thesis. My passion lies in applying advanced computational techniques to solve real-world problems, and I am particularly interested in the intersection of quantum computing and machine learning.</p>

        <li><b>Gas Leak Detection & Explosion Prevention with Air Quality Monitoring System</b><br>
        <i>Course:</i> Microprocessor & Embedded Systems Laboratory <br>
        <i>Supervisor:</i> Sadman Sakib Ahbab <br>
        Designed an ultimate engineering solution against gas leak explosions by detecting gas leaks and taking preventive measures such as limiting them and alerting the user via a mobile phone call. Air quality measurements were also taken.</li><br>

        <li><b>Aquatic Multi-purpose Robot for Water Surface Trash Cleaning and Water Quality Monitoring</b><br>
        <i>Course:</i> Control Systems 1 Laboratory <br>
        <i>Supervisor:</i> Dr. Mohammad Ariful Haque <br>
        Designed a cost-effective robot to detect and collect trash on water surfaces, both by automated and manual control. It also had sensors to detect water quality such as pH and temperature.</li><br>

        <li><b>Design of a 4-bit Calculator</b><br>
        <i>Course:</i> Digital Logic Design Laboratory <br>
        <i>Supervisor:</i> Sadman Sakib Ahbab <br>
        Designed separate circuit blocks for performing operations: encoding, enabling, addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and decoding. These blocks were integrated to obtain a fully functional calculator.</li><br>

        <li><b>COVID-19 Forecasting in Bangladesh</b><br>
        <i>Course:</i> Digital Signal Processing I Laboratory <br>
        <i>Supervisor:</i> Tanvir Mahmud <br>
        Time series prediction of the number of COVID-19 cases in Bangladesh using Fbprophet, LSTM, and MLP models.</li><br>

        <li><b>Intelligent Gesture Based Security System</b><br>
        <i>Course:</i> Communication Laboratory <br>
        <i>Supervisor:</i> Shahed-E-Zumrat <br>
        Designed a contactless security system that is unlocked by means of a stored hand gesture pattern. The simulation was performed using MATLAB, VSPE, Arduino, and Proteus.</li><br>

        <li><b>Electronic Analog Computer Solving a Second Order Differential Equation</b><br>
        <i>Course:</i> Electronics Circuits II Laboratory <br>
        <i>Supervisor:</i> Dr. Muhammad Abdullah Arafat <br>
