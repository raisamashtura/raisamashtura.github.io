        <p>Hello! My name is Raisa Mashtura. I am a Lecturer at the Department of Computer Science & Engineering at BRAC University. My research interests include Digital Signal Processing, Quantum Machine Learning, and Neural Networks.</p>
        
        <p>I hold a Bachelor of Science degree in Electrical and Electronic Engineering from Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET), where I specialized in Communication & Signal-Processing with a CGPA of 3.90/4.00.</p>
        
        <p>I have worked on numerous projects, including designing a Quantum Convolutional Neural Network for the Classification of Classical Data, which was part of my undergraduate thesis. My passion lies in applying advanced computational techniques to solve real-world problems, and I am particularly interested in the intersection of quantum computing and machine learning.</p>
